This directory contains files used when building Windows 2000/XP GUI 
installers for XSB using Inno Setup 5.2 (or a later version):

	http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php

In order to build the installer, perform the following steps:

1. Install (or update if necessary) Inno Setup.

2. Compile XSB, if possible, in 32 bits and 64 bits, single-threaded and
multi-threaded.

2. Copy the "xsb.iss" file into your Desktop folder and open it (using
Inno Setup).

3. The "xsb.iss" file assumes that XSB is compiled and available in the
"C:\XSB" folder. If that's not the case, edit the "xsb.iss" file and
change the definition of the variable "MyBaseDir" (around line 13) to
reflect the directory that you're using.

4. Update the XSB release number in the "xsb.iss".
   Look for the strings "XSBVersion".
   Also check the XSB copyright information for possible updates.

5. In the Inno Setup Compiler application, run the menu command
"Build > Compile".

6. Assuming no build errors the generated installer will be found on
your Desktop inside the "Output" directory (or in Output subdirectory
of where xsb.iss was run.)

7. Then upload it to xsb.sourceforge.net.  Login and go to "files"
tab, and then navigate to the desired directory.  And then button
"add file".

8. Update the downloads page; in XSB/docs/homepage/downloads.html:
Update to have right filename for windows installer.  Then upload it
to sf:

In that directory:
 scp downloads.html dwarren,xsb@web.sourceforge.net:/home/project-web/xsb/htdocs/downloads

Then upload installer:
On https://sourceforge.net/projects/xsb/files/xsb/ click 
   Add Folder, give it a proper name
   Click on that folder and upload the installer -- also using a propoer
   name. See how it was done before. Click the i (info) button to indicate
   which OSs this installer is for (Windows in this case).
