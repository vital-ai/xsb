title={Extended Semantics and  Inference for the {Independent Choice Logic}},
journal={Logic Journal of the IGPL},
publisher={Oxford University Press},
note={to appear},
year={2009},
abstract={The Independent Choice Logic (ICL) is a  language for expressing 
probabilistic information in logic programming that adopts a distribution 
semantics: an ICL theory defines a distribution over a set of possible worlds 
that are normal logic programs. The probability of a query is then given by the 
sum of the probabilities of worlds where the query is true.

The ICL semantics requires the theories to be acyclic. This is a strong 
limitation that rules out many interesting programs.
In this paper we present an extension of the ICL semantics that allows theories 
to be modularly acyclic.

Inference with ICL can be performed with the Cilog2 system that  computes 
explanations to queries and then  makes them mutually incompatible by means of 
an iterative algorithm.

We propose the system PICL (for Probabilistic inference with ICL) that computes 
the explanations to queries by means of a modification of SLDNF\--resolution 
and then makes them mutually incompatible by means of Binary Decision Diagrams.

PICL and Cilog2 are compared on problems that involve computing the probability 
of a connection between two nodes in biological graphs and social networks. 
PICL turned to be more efficient, handling larger networks/more complex queries 
in a shorter time than Cilog2. This is true both for marginal and for 
conditional queries.

journal={Journal of Algorithms in Logic, Informatics and Cognition },
publisher={Elsevier},
note={,\ in press},
year=2009,
abstract={Logic Programs with Annotated Disjunctions (LPADs) allow to express 
probabilistic information in logic programming. The semantics of an LPAD is 
given in terms of well\--founded models of the normal logic programs obtained 
by selecting one disjunct from each ground LPAD clause. 

Inference on LPADs can be performed using either the system Ailog2, that was 
developed for the Independent Choice Logic, or SLDNFAD, an algorithm based on 
SLDNF.  However, both of these algorithms run the risk of going into infinite 
loops and of performing redundant computations.

In order to avoid these problems, we present SLGAD resolution that  computes 
the (conditional) probability of a ground query from a range\--restricted LPAD 
and is  based on  SLG resolution for normal logic programs. As SLG, it uses 
tabling to avoid some infinite loops and to avoid redundant computations.

The performances of SLGAD are evaluated on classical benchmarks for normal logic 
programs under the well\--founded semantics, namely a 2\--person game and the 
ancestor relation, and on a game of dice.

SLGAD is compared with  Ailog2 and  SLDNFAD on the problems in which they do 
not go into infinite loops, namely those that are described by a  modularly 
acyclic program.

On the 2\--person game and the ancestor relation, SLGAD is more expensive than 
SLDNFAD on problems where SLDNFAD succeeds but is faster than Ailog2 when the 
query is true in an exponential number of instances.

If the program requires the repeated computation of similar goals, as for the 
dice game, then SLGAD outperforms both Ailog2 and SLDNFAD.},

	but related languages for expressing probabilistic information in
	logic programming. The paper presents a top down interpreter for
	computing the probability of a query from a program in one of these
	two languages. The algorithm is based on the one available for ProbLog.
	The performances of the algorithm are compared with those of a Bayesian
	reasoner and with those of the ProbLog interpreter. On programs that
	have a small grounding, the Bayesian reasoner is more scalable, but
	programs with a large grounding require the top down interpreter.
	The comparison with ProbLog shows that the added expressiveness effectively
	requires more computation resources.},
