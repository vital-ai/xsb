\chapter{Getting Started with XSB} \label{quick_start}
%=====================================================

This section describes the steps needed to install XSB under UNIX and
under Windows.

\section{Installing XSB under UNIX}
%==================================
\label{installation_options}

If you are installing on a UNIX platform, the version of XSB that you
received may not include all the object code files so that an
installation will be necessary.  The easiest way to install XSB is to
use the following procedure.

\begin{enumerate}
\item	Decide in which directory in your file system you want to install
  XSB and copy or move XSB there.
\item Make sure that after you have obtained XSB, you have
  uncompressed it by following the instructions found in the file {\tt
    README}.
  
\item Note that after you uncompress and untar the XSB tar file, a
  subdirectory {\tt XSB} will be created in the current directory. All
  XSB files will be located in that subdirectory.  In the rest of this
  manual, we use {\tt \$XSB\_DIR} to refer to this subdirectory.  Note
  the original directory structure of XSB must be maintained, namely,
  the directory {\tt \$XSB\_DIR} should contain all the subdirectories
  and files that came with the distribution. In particular, the
  following directories are required for XSB to work: \verb'emu',
  \verb'syslib', \verb'cmplib', \verb'lib', \verb'packages',
  \verb'build', and \verb'etc'.

\index{configuration}
\index{installation into shared directories}
\item Change directory to {\tt \$XSB\_DIR/build} and then run these commands:
  %%
  \begin{quote}
    \tt
    configure\\
    \tt
    makexsb
  \end{quote}
  %%
  %%$
  This is it!
  
  In addition, it is now possible to install XSB in a shared directory
  ({\it e.g.}, {\tt /usr/local}) for everyone to use.  In this situation,
  you should use the following sequence of commands:
  %%
  \begin{quote}
    \tt
    configure --prefix=\$SHARED\_XSB\\
    \tt
    makexsb\\
    \tt
    makexsb install
  \end{quote}
  %%$
  where {\tt \$SHARED\_XSB}  denotes the shared directory where XSB is
  installed.  In all cases, XSB can be run using the script
  %%$
  \begin{quote}
    \tt
    \$XSB\_DIR/bin/xsb
  \end{quote}
  However, if XSB is installed in a central location, the script for
  general use is:
  \begin{quote}
    \verb'<central-installation-directory>/<xsb-version>/bin/xsb'
  \end{quote}
\end{enumerate}
  %%

{\bf Important:} The XSB executable determines the location of the
libraries it needs based on the full path name by which it was invoked.
The ``smart script'' \verb|bin/xsb| also uses its full path name to
determine the location of the various scripts that it needs in order to
figure out the configuration of your machine.  Therefore, there are certain
limitations on how XSB can be invoked.

Here are some legal ways to invoke XSB:
%%
\begin{enumerate}
\item  invoking the smart script \verb|bin/xsb| or the XSB executable using
  their absolute or relative path name.
\item using an alias for \verb|bin/xsb| or the executable.
\item creating a new shell script that invokes either \verb|bin/xsb| or the
  XSB executable using their {\em full\/} path names. 
\end{enumerate}
%%

Here are some ways that are guaranteed to not work in some or all cases:
%%
\begin{enumerate}
\item  creating a hard link to either \verb|bin/xsb| or the executable and
  using {\it it\/} to invoke XSB. (Symbolic links should be ok.)
\item changing the relative position of either \verb|bin/xsb| or the
  XSB executable with respect to the rest of the XSB directory tree.
\end{enumerate}
%%

The configuration script allows many different options to be
specified.  A full listing can be obtained by typing {\tt
\$XSB\_DIR/build/configure --help}.
%%
\begin{description}
\item[Type of Machine.]  The configuration script automatically
  detects your machine and OS type, and builds XSB accordingly. On
  64-bit platforms, the default compilation of XSB will reflect the
  default for the C compiler (e.g. gcc) on that platform.  Moreover,
  you can build XSB for different architectures while using the same
  tree and the same installation directory provided, of course, that
  these machines are sharing this directory, say using NFS or
  Samba. All you will have to do is to login to a different machine
  with a different architecture or OS type, and repeat the above
  sequence of commands -- or configure with different parameters.
  
  The configuration files for different architectures reside in
  different directories, and there is no danger of an architecture
  conflict.  In fact, you can keep using the same {\tt ./bin/xsb}
  script regardless of the architecture. It will detect your
  configuration and will use the right files for the right
  architecture!

  If XSB is being built on a Windows machine in which Cygwin
  is installed, Cygwin and Windows are treated as separate operating
  systems, as their APIs are completely different.  On such a machine, XSB
  can be built either for Cygwin or Windows.

\index{cc (compiler)} \index{gcc} \index{acc (compiler)}  
\item[Choice of the C Compiler and compiler-related
  options] \label{cc} On Unix systems, XSB is developed and tested
  mainly using gcc.  Accordingly, the {\tt configure} script will
  attempt to use {\tt gcc}, if it is available.  Otherwise, it will
  revert to {\tt cc} or {\tt acc}.  Some versions of {\tt gcc} are
  broken for particular platforms or {\tt gcc} may not have been
  installed; in which case you would have to give {\tt configure} an
  additional directive {\tt --with-cc} (or {\tt --with-acc}).  If you
  must use some special compiler, use {\tt
    --with-cc=your-own-compiler}.  You can also use the {\tt
    --with-optimization} option to change the default C compiler
  optimization level.  (or {\tt --disable-optimization} to disable all
  compiler optimizations).  {\tt --enable-debug} is mainly a
  development option that allows XSB to be debugged using gdb -- there
  are many other compiler-based options options.  Type {\tt configure
    --help} to see them all. Also see the file~\verb'$XSB_DIR/INSTALL'
  for more details.

\item[Word Size] XSB's configuration script checks whether the default
  compilation mode of a platform is 32- or 64-bits, and will build a
  version of XSB accoringly.  Some platforms, however, support both
  32-bit and 64-bit compilation.  On such a platform, a user can
  explicitly specify the type of compilation using the options {\tt
    with-bits32} and {\tt with-bits64}.  

\item[XSB and Site-specific Information] Using the option {\tt
  --prefix=PREFIX} installs architecture-independent files in the
  directory {\tt PREFIX}, e.g. {\tt /usr/local}, which can be useful
  if XSB is to be shared at a site.  Using the option {\tt
    --site-prefix=DIR} installs site-specific libraries in {\tt
    DIR/site}.  Other options indicate directories in which to search
  for site-specific static and dynamic libraries, and for include
  files.

%\item[Multi-threading] Version 3.0 of XSB was the first version that
%  supports multi-threading.  On some platforms, the multi-threaded
%  engine is slightly slower than the single-threaded engine, mostly
%  due to its need for concurrency control.  To obtain the benefits of
%  multiple threads on a platform that supports either POSIX or Windows
%  threads (i.e.  nearly all platforms) users must configure XSB with
 % the directive {\tt enable-mt} (see Section~\ref{sec:mt-windows} for
%  instructions specific to Windows. The multi-threaded engine works
%  with other configuration options, multi-threading can be compiled
%  with batched or local scheduling, with the ODBC or InterProlog
%  interfaces, and so on.

%%$
\index{InterProlog!Interface}
\index{Oracle Interface}
\index{SModels Interface}
\index{XASP}
\index{ODBC Interface}
\index{Tck/Tk}
\index{Interface!InterProlog}
\index{Interface!Oracle}
\index{Interface!SModels}
\index{XASP}
\index{Interface!ODBC}

\item[Interfaces] Certain interfaces must be designated at
configuration time, including those to Oracle, ODBC, Smodels, Tck/Tk,
and Libwww.  However, the XSB-calling-C interface interface does not
need to be specified at configuration time.  If you wish to use the
InterProlog Java interface that is based on JNI, you must
specify this at configuration time; otherwise if you wish to use the
sockets-based InterProlog interface, it does not need to be specified
at configuration time.  See Volume 2 and the InterProlog site {\tt
www.declarativa.com} for details of specific interfaces

While the XSB configuration mechanism can detect most include and
library paths, use of certain interfaces may require information about
particular directories.  In particular the {\tt
--with-static-libraries} option might be needed if compiling with
support for statically linked packages (such as Oracle) or if your
standard C libraries are in odd places. Alternately, dynamic libraries
on odd places may need to be specified at configuration time using the
{\tt --with-dynamic-libraries} option.  and finally, the {\tt
--with-includes} option might be needed if your standard header files
(or your {\tt jni.h} file) are in odd places, or if XSB is compiled
with ODBC support.  Type {\tt configure --help} for more details.

%%$
\index{scheduling strategy}
\item[Type of Scheduling Strategy.]  The ordering of operations within
a tabled evaluation can drastically affect its performance.  XSB
provides two scheduling strategies: Batched Evaluation and Local
Evaluation.  Local Evaluation ensures that, whenever possible,
subgoals are fully evaluated before there answers are returned, and
provides superior behavior for programs in which tabled negation is
used.  Batched Evaluation evaluates queries to reduce the time to the
first answer of a query.  Both evaluation methods can be useful for
different programs.  Since Version 2.4, Local Evaluation has been the
default evaluation method for XSB.  Batched Evaluation can be chosen
via the {\tt --enable-batched-scheduling} configure option.  Detailed
explanations of the scheduling strategies can be found in
\cite{JFLP-Scheduling}, and further experimentation in \cite{CaSW02}.

\end{description}

Other options are of interest to advanced users who wish to experiment
with XSB, or to use XSB for large-scale projects.  In general, however
users need not concern themselves with these options.

\subsection{Possible Installation Problems}


\paragraph*{Lack of Space for Optimized Compilation of C Code}
When making the optimized version of the emulator, the temporary space
available to the C compiler for intermediate files is sometimes not
sufficient. For example on one of our SPARCstations that had very
little {\tt /tmp} space the {\tt "-O4"} option could not be used for
the compilation of files {\tt emuloop.c}, and {\tt tries.c}, without
changing the default {\tt tmp} directory and increasing the swap
space.  Depending on your C compiler, the amount and nature of {\tt
/tmp} and swap space of your machine you may or may not encounter
problems.  If you are using the SUN C compiler, and have disk space in
one of your directories, say {\tt dir}, add the following option to
the entries of any files that cannot be compiled:

\demo{       -temp=dir}

\noindent
If you are using the GNU C compiler, consult its manual pages
to find out how you can change the default {\tt tmp} directory or how you
can use pipes to avoid the use of temporary space during compiling.
Usually changing the default directory can be done by declaring/modifying
the {\tt TMPDIR} environment variable as follows:

\demo{       setenv TMPDIR dir}

\paragraph*{Missing XSB Object Files}
When an object (*.xwam) file is missing from the {\tt lib} directories
you can normally run the {\tt make} command in that directory to
restore it (instructions for doing so are given in Chapter
\ref{quick_start}).  However, to restore an object file in the
directories {\tt syslib} and {\tt cmplib}, one needs to have a
separate Prolog compiler accessible (such as a separate copy of
XSB), because the XSB compiler uses most of the files in these
two directories and hence will not function when some of them are
missing.  For this reason, distributed versions normally include all
the object files in {\tt syslib} and {\tt cmplib}.

\paragraph*{XSB on 64-bit platforms}
\index{64-bit architectures}
%
XSB has been fully tested on 64-bit Debian Linux, 64-bit and Mac OS X.
However, the sockets library may have problems in \version{}.  If this
limitation prove a problem, please contact {\tt
  xsb-development@lists.sourceforge.net}~\footnote{64-bit XSB was
  broken in a recent releases prior to Version 3.1 because for a time
  the developers did not have access to a 64-bit machine.}.

Typically, if the 64-bit system generates 32-bit code by default, XSB
will run just as in 32-bit mode (including 64-bit floats).  64-bit
compilation can be forced for XSB by configuring with the option {\tt
  --with-bits64}, and in a similar manner 32-bit compilation can be
forced with the option {\tt --with-bits32}.  Users who employ either
option should be aware of issues that may arise when linking XSB to
external C code.  
\bi
\item When XSB calls C code the C file must have been compiled with
  the same memory option as XSB.  This is done automatically if the C
  file is compiled via a call from XSB's compiler, but must be handled
  by the user otherwise.  For instance, if XSB were configured {\tt
    --with-bits32} on a 64-bit machine defaulting to 64-bits, then C
  files called by XSB require the {\tt -m32} option in {\tt gcc} (if
  not compiled by XSB).
\item The appropriate memory option must be used when embedding XSB
  into a C or Java process.  For instance, if a XSB is to be linked
  into a 32-bit application on a 64-bit platform defaulting to
  64-bits, XSB must be configured {\tt --with-bits32}, and the linking
  of {\tt xsb.o/so} to the calling program must specify {\tt -m32}.
  \ei

\section{Installing XSB under Windows}
\subsection{Using Cygwin32 and Cygwin64}
\label{quick:cygwin}

This is easy: just follow the Unix instructions.
XSB can be built under CygWin64 or CygWin32, but in the latter case
CygWin32 must be installed on a 32 bit version of Windows.
XSB \emph{cannot} be built under CygWin32 if the latter is installed on a
64 bit Windows.

\noindent
\textbf{Note}: XSB is not fully functional under Cygwin---external C modules
cannot be linked and so several packages will not work.

\subsection{Using Microsoft Visual C++}
\label{quick:DOS}
%==========================================

\begin{enumerate}
\item Check XSB out from SVN:\\
  \texttt{svn checkout} \url{svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/xsb/src/trunk} \texttt{xsb-src}
\item Compile XSB as described below.
  This requires that Microsoft Visual Studio is installed.
\item After compiling XSB, it is OK to move it to some other place, if needed.
   However, make sure that the
   entire directory tree is moved --- the XSB executable looks for the files it
   needs relatively to its current position in the file system.
\end{enumerate}


The first thing is to ensure that
Microsoft Visual Studio that includes a C++ compiler, so
\emph{download the free of charge Microsoft Visual Studio, Community
    Edition} from
%% 
\begin{verbatim}
  https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/
\end{verbatim}
%% 
Make sure you \emph{select the C++ compiler}   as one of the additional components
to include (e.g., choose ``Desktop development with C++'').
The installer will place the studio in
\texttt{C:$\backslash$Program Files$\backslash$Microsoft Visual
  Studio$\backslash$}.

One way to compile XSB under Windows is to use the automatic installer:
%% 
\begin{quote}
\texttt{cd \$XSB\_DIR}   
\\
\texttt{java -jar InstallXSB.jar}
\end{quote}
%% 
where \texttt{\$XSB\_DIR} is the XSB's installation directory,
and follow the prompts. The trickiest of these prompts will ask you to provide the
full file name of the studio's settings batch file.
For Visual Studio 2017, Community Edition,
that file is \texttt{vcvarsx86\_amd64.bat} (for 64 bit apps) or
  \texttt{vcvars32.bat} (for 32 bit apps), located in the directory
  \vspace{1mm}\\
\texttt{
      C:$\backslash$Program Files\,(x86)$\backslash$Microsoft Visual Studio$\backslash$2017$\backslash$Community$\backslash$VC$\backslash$Auxiliary$\backslash$Build
    }
    \\
    In other versions of the studio, that file is elsewhere and can be
    found using the Windows search widget. For instance, in the 2015
    version of the studio, that directory is
\texttt{
      C:$\backslash$Program Files\,(x86)$\backslash$Microsoft Visual Studio 2015$\backslash$VC$\backslash$bin
    }

If the automatic method just described
does not work or if one needs customized installation,
one has to compile XSB the ``hard
way,'' as described below.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Find the settings file, which you need to execute in a command
  window in order to set the compilation environment}, as described above.
\item
    Open a Windows command prompt window and
    drag the appropriate batch file (\texttt{vcvarsx86\_amd64.bat} or
    \texttt{vcvars32.bat}) into it. Type \texttt{<Enter>} to execute that
    batch file. 
\item
   {\tt cd \$XSB\_DIR$\backslash$build}  
\item
To compile XSB as a 64 bit application, use the following command, where the
items in square brackets are optional and usually can be dropped:\\
  {\small{\tt makexsb64\,["CFG=opt"]\,["ORACLE=yes"]\,["MY\_LIBRARY\_DIRS=libs"]\,["MY\_INCLUDE\_DIRS=opts"]}}
  %%
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The options for {\tt CFG} are: \emph{release} (default) or \emph{debug}.  The
    latter is used when you want to compile XSB with debugging enabled.
  \item The {\tt ORACLE} parameter (default is ``no'') compiles XSB with
    native support for Oracle DBMS. If {\tt ORACLE} is
    specified, you {\bf must} also specify the necessary Oracle libraries
    using the parameter {\tt SITE\_LIBS}.
    Native Oracle support is rarely used and ODBC is the recommended way to
    connect to databases.
  \item \texttt{MY\_LIBRARY\_DIRS} is used to specify the external
    libraries and \texttt{libs} there has the form  \texttt{/LIBPATH:"libdir1"
    /LIBPATH:"libdir2" ...}.  
  \item \texttt{MY\_INCLUDE\_DIRS} is used to specify additional
    directories for included files. Here \texttt{opts} has the form
    \texttt{/I"incdir1" /I"incdir2" ...}.  
  \end{itemize}
  %%
  Instead of specifying the options on command line,
  it might be more convenient (and more general) to create the file
  %% 
\begin{verbatim}
  XSB\build\windows64\custom_settings.mak  
\end{verbatim}
  %% 
  and put the required options there. For instance,
  %% 
\begin{verbatim}
XSB_INTERPROLOG=yes 
MY_INCLUDE_DIRS=/I"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_131\include" \
      /I"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_131\include\win32" 
MY_LIBRARY_DIRS=/LIBPATH:"C:\pthreads\pthreadVC1.lib" /libpath:"C:\oracle"
ORACLE=yes
\end{verbatim}
  %% 
Make sure you do not misspell the name of that file or else none of the
specified options will take effect!
   
 \item The above command will compile XSB as requested and will put the XSB 
   executable and its DLL in:
%%
\[
\begin{array}{l}
 \tt
 \$XSB\_DIR\backslash{}config\backslash\texttt{x64-pc-windows}\backslash{}bin\backslash{}xsb.exe
\\
 \tt
 \$XSB\_DIR\backslash{}config\backslash\texttt{x64-pc-windows}\backslash{}bin\backslash{}xsb.dll
 \end{array}
\]

\item To compile XSB as a 32 bit application (\textbf{not} recommended),
  use \texttt{makexsb} instead of
  \texttt{makexsb64}. The compiled code will be installed   in
  %%
\[
\begin{array}{l}
 \tt
 \$XSB\_DIR\backslash{}config\backslash\texttt{x86-pc-windows}\backslash{}bin\backslash{}xsb.exe
\\
 \tt
 \$XSB\_DIR\backslash{}config\backslash\texttt{x86-pc-windows}\backslash{}bin\backslash{}xsb.dll
 \end{array}
\]
%%
\end{enumerate}
%%
The \texttt{custom\_settings.mak} file must then be in
%% 
\begin{verbatim}
  XSB\build\windows\custom_settings.mak  
\end{verbatim}
%% 

\noindent
{\bf Note}: if you compiled XSB with one set of parameters and then want to
recompile with a different set, it is recommended that you run
%%
\begin{verbatim}
 makexsb64  clean  
\end{verbatim}
%%
in between the compilations (or \texttt{makexsb clean} in the 32-bit
case).  
This also applies to recompilations for 64/32 bits.


\section{Invoking XSB}
%=====================

Under Unix, XSB can be invoked by the command:
\begin{quote}
       \tt \$XSB\_DIR/bin/xsb
\end{quote}
%%$
if you have installed XSB in your private directory.  If XSB is
installed in a shared directory ({\it e.g.}, {\tt \$SHARED\_XSB} for
the entire site (UNIX only), then you should use
\begin{quote}
       \tt \$SHARED\_XSB/bin/xsb
\end{quote}
%%
In both cases, you will find yourself in the top level interpreter.  
As mentioned above, this script automatically detects the system
configuration you are running on and will use the right files and
executables. (Of course, XSB should have been built for that architecture
earlier.)

Under Windows, you should invoke XSB by typing:
\[
 \tt
 \$XSB\_DIR\backslash{}bin\backslash{}xsb
\]
This script tries to find the XSB executable and invoke it. If, for some
reason, it fails to do so, the user should call the executable directly.
\[
 \tt
 \$XSB\_DIR\backslash{}config\backslash\texttt{x86-pc-windows}\backslash{}bin\backslash{}xsb.exe
\]
%%


You may want to make an alias such as {\tt \smallourprolog} to the above
commands, for convenience, or you might want to put the directory where the
XSB command is found in the {\tt \$PATH} environment variable. However, you
should {\bf not} make hard links to this script or to the XSB executable.
If you invoke XSB via such a hard link, XSB will likely be confused and will
not find its libraries.  That said, you {\bf can} create other scripts and
call the above script from there.

ISO``standard'' Prolog predicates are supported by XSB, in addition to
many other predicates: so those of you who consider yourselves
champion entomologists, can try to test them for bugs now.  Details
are in Chapter~\ref{standard}.


\section{Compiling XSB programs}
%===============================

One way to compile a program from a file, such as {\tt myfile.P} in
the current directory and load it into memory, is to type the query:
\begin{verbatim}
     [my_file].
\end{verbatim}
where \verb'my_file' is the name of the file.
Chapter~\ref{chap:system} contains a full discussion of the compiling
and consulting.

If you are eccentric (or you don't know how to use an editor) you can also 
compile and load predicates input directly from the terminal by using the
command:
\begin{verbatim}
     [user].
\end{verbatim}
A {\tt CTRL-d} or the atom \verb'end_of_file' followed by a period 
terminates the input stream.


\section{Sample XSB Programs}
%============================

There are several sample XSB source programs in the directory: {\tt
  \$XSB\_DIR/examples} illustrating a number of standard features, as
well as a number of non-standardized or XSB-specific features
including plain tabling, incremental tabling, tabling with negation,
attributed variables, annotated programs, constraint handling rules,
XSB embedded in a C program, XSB calling C functions, sockets, and
various semantic web application

Hence, a sample session might look like
(the actual times shown below may vary and some extra information is given
using comments after the \% character):
