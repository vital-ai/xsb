  Packages and interfaces have become an increasingly important part
  of XSB.  They are an important way to incorporate code from other
  systems into XSB, and to interface XSB to databases and other
  stores.  Most of the packages had significant contributions by
  people other than the core XSB developers, for which we are
  grateful.  As a result most chapters have information about its
  authors.

%The ODBC interface was took as its starting point the Oracle
%  interface, and was written by Lily Dong and Baoqiu Cui, and
%  maintained by David Warren.  The interface to POSIX regular
%  expression and wildcard matching as well as the Libwww-based Web
%  access package was written by Michael Kifer.  The interface to Perl
%  pattern matching routines was written by Michael Kifer and Jin Yu.
%  The SModels interface was written by Luis F. Castro.
  
%  The SLX preprocessor was written by Jos\'e J\'ulio Alferes and
%  Lu\'is Moniz Pereira.  Unix-style scripting libraries were written
%  by Terrance Swift, and the ordset library was written by Richard
%  O'Keefe.
