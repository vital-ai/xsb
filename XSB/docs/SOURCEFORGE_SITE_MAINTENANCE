Sourceforge keeps changing its policies and procedures for site
maintenance.  Here are the notes from putting out version 4.0

To update the web page do the following steps.

-- make whatever changes you need in docs/homepage, and when you are
   done update git.

-- log in to shell.sourceforge.net (as yourself or xsb). This is done
   as:

ssh -t <name>,xsb@shell.sourceforge.net create

then cd to /home/project-web/xsb/htdocs

Copy into the various directories any of the .html or other files you
need.  Eg.

scp index.html <name>,xsb@web.sourceforge.net:/home/project-web/xsb/htdocs

-- For full releases, add the release file following the instructions found from clicking on the Files tab in https://sourceforge.net/projects/xsb.

-- There are several other directories that may need to be updated.

api -- has generated documentation for XSB    /* TES: not maintained in v. 3.2 */
manual1 -- subdirectory for manual vol. 1     /* TES: not maintained in v. 3.2 */
manual2 -- subdirectory for manual vol. 2     /* TES: not maintained in v. 3.2 */
packages -- subdirecotry for packages manuals 

-- Finally, update the news.  Login to sourceforge, under the admin
menu, click news, then submit.  this will bring you to a form where
you can submit the news story.

For Binaries, you can run 

admin/TarRelease.sh (Needs to be updated for git) 

to make an XSB.tar.gz and an XSB.zip, then move the tar file
somewhere, untar it, cd to the admin directory, and run
configure_release.sh.  This makes optimized versions of

sequential, 64-bit, local

Next, run TarBin.sh to create tarball, and copy over to sourceforge.

Problems

If the xsb password expires, you can't login to shell.sourceforge.net,
even though you can log into sourceforge through a browser.  If this
happens, simply change the password through the browser and things
should work (make sure to notify the relevant developers).
