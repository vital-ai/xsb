<h1>Release Notes</h1>

<h2> Version 3.2-pre</h2>

Version 3.2 is a major rewriting of XSB that includes new
functionalities and significantly improves XSB's stability and speed.
Some of the improvements for Version 3.2 are as follows.

<h3>Constraint libraries</h3>
     While XSB has long supported attributed variables and constraint
     handling rules, it has been missing constraint libraries for the
     past few versions.  Version 3.2 includes both CLP(R) and a simple
     finite domain range solver.  Constraint evaluation is private to
     each thread, and handlers are available whether XSB is called
     from the command-line or embedded on a process.

<h3>Improved tabling with call subsumption</h3>
     Call subsumption now supports evaluation over the full
     well-founded semantics as well as supporting attributed variables
     in answers.  In a multi-threaded environment call subsumption is
     fully supported for private tables, and is more scalable than in
     version 3.1.

<h3>Compatibility with ISO standards</h3>
<ul>
<li>
     <i>Core ISO Standard</i> XSB is now in closer accord with the core ISO
     standard in its handling of arithmetic expressions and exception
     handling for various ISO predicates; in addition sub_atom/5 and
     char_code/2 are now implemented, as are evaluable functions **/2
     and sign/1.
</li>

<li>
     <i>Core Revision</i> ISO predicates call_cleanup/2,
     call/[2-10], evaluable functions '><'/2 and arithmetic constants
     pi/0 and e/o are now implemented.  In addition, user_error,
     user_warning, and user_message stream aliases have been added.
</li>

<li>
     <i>Draft ISO Multi-Threading Standard</i> Aliases for ISO-style
     mutexes are now better supported, and thread_create/3 allows
     specification of an at_exit handler.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Improved compatibility with other Prologs and installation</h3>
     XSB's atom-based module system has different behavior than the
     predicate-based module system of most other Prologs, but in most
     cases XSB now supports the syntax common to most module systems.
     module/1 is now synonymous with export/1 and use_module/2 is now
     synonymous with import/2. Explicit module calls using :/2 are
     supported in most places.
<p>
     Limited support for statistics/2 is also now available.  time/1
     also added, for compatibility with SWI and YAP.  Also, multifile
     now fully supports dynamic and static predicates.
</p>
     In addition, XSB is now easier to install as a package on Mac OS
     X.

<h3>Speed Improvements</h3>

     XSB's arithmetic is now much faster as well as throwing errors
     that are more ISO-compatible.  Compiler changes were made to
     exploit determinism in conditional tests.  In addition, speed
     improvements were also made to assert/1, trie_assert/1,
     retract/1, retractall/1, and call/1.

<h3>Improvements to 64-bit evaluation</h3> 

     64-bit XSB now runs properly on Macs (in addition to Linux).
     Boxed floats on 64 bit port give floating point computation that
     is fully IEEE compatible.  read_canonical/[1,2], and
     fmt_write/[1,2] now work for 64 bits.  max_integer and
     min_integer are now correct in 64-bit evaluation.

<h3>Improvements in multi-threading</h3>
      The MT engine has been made more stable and efficient overall,
     for both non-tabled and tabled code.
<p>
     For private tables Version 3.2 provides greatly improved
     scalability.  For shared tables under local evaluation (shared
     completed tables), more concurrency is now possible and fewer
     thread wake-ups now occur.  Code is also more robust in
     (pathological) cases of cascading usurpations.
</p>
     In addition to public message queues, private message queues and
     signal queues are now supported.  All queues in the MT engine are
     now more stable.  thread_sleep/1 is now cancelable i.e. sleeping
     threads may be cancelled.  In addition, predicates
     thread_property/2, threads/0 and thread_peek_message/1 are now
     supported.

<h3>Foreign-Language Interface</h3>
     Changes now allow XSB and C to call each other recursively, both
     in the single-threaded and the multi-threaded engines.

<h3>Interned Tries</h3>
     XSB allows efficient interning of terms within trie data
     structures.  A new API for interned tries is now available that
     supports both thread-private and thread-shared tries, and allows
     for different levels of (safe) memory management when terms are
     deleted from tries.

<h3>XASP package</h3>
     The Smodels engine is now distributed with XSB making XASP
     installation easier.  XASP is now more stable on cygwin and some
     elements of XASP are thread safe.

<h3>dbdrivers package</h3>
     The dbdrivers package now supports embedded mysql, so that XSB
     can be configured to directly call mysql without requiring a
     separate mysql driver.  Memory leaks also fixed for dbdrivers
     package.

<h3>Profiling</h3>
     XSB's profiling now has primitive functionality for determining
     what modes (and how many times) a call is being made.

<h3>random.P</h3>
     Generation of weibull, exponential, and normal distributions is
     now supported.

<h3>Memory management</h3>
     <i>string garbage collection</i> Heuristics changed to avoid
     unnecessary calls
<p>
     <i>table garbage collection</i> has more thorough reclamation of
     abolished table space.  In addition, table garbage collection now
     checks delay lists so that garbage collection within
     non-stratified queries is safer.
</p>

     Garbage collection of retracted dynamic clauses works better and
     faster, and heap garbage collection is more stable.
